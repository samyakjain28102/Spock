# Spock-Paper-Scissors-Rock-Lizard

This game became famous because Sheldon from 'The Big Bang Theory' played this.

Let's go through the rules once,

"Scissors decapitate Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."

And just like that, you go through a certain number of rounds and decide if you are lucky enough to win!

Happy Playing!
